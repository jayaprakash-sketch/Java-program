Inheritance:
>inheritance is a fundamental concept in oops.
>it is the mechanism in java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features
(fields and method)of another method.
>inheritance means creating the new classes based on the existing once, the class that inherit that another class can reuse the methods
and fields of the class.

How inherit works in java:
>The extends keywords is used for inheritance in java it enables the subclass inherit to fields and the methods of the super class(parent class), when a class extends another class it means it inherits all the non-primitive members(fields and methods)of the parent class and 
the subclass can also overwrite or new functionality to that.
types:
single, multilevel , hierarchical , multiple , Hybrid.
*Single:
>in single inheritance a subclass is derived from or only one super class or only one parent class. 
>it inherit the property and behaviour of a single parent class.

*Multilevel inheritance:
>A multilevel inheritance is based on the derived  class acts as a base classes for the another classes
*hierarchical:
>more than one subclass is inherited from a single baseclass.
>ex:more than one dreived class is created from in single baseclass.for ex, cars and busses both are vehicles
*Multiple inheritance
> Mli can have more than one superclass and inherit to features from all parent class.
